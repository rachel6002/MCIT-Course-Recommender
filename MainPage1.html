The main topics of the course include: rotation matrices, homogeneous transformations, manipulator forward and inverse kinematics, mobile robot kinematics, Jacobians, and trajectory planning. The purpose of the course is to provide you with a mathematical, computational and practical foundation for future explorations into the robotics field. Students should have knowledge of simple geometry and trigonometry (triangle inequalities, sine, cosine), previous exposure to linear algebra (matrices and vectors), and previous programming experience. Although MEAM 211 is often listed as a prerequisite for the on-campus version of this course, it is not strictly required. Previous experience in simple rigid body kinematics will be useful.",

The promise of DLTs has attracted billions of dollars in investments, yet the true potential of these systems remains unclear. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of cryptography and distributed systems that underpin modern blockchain platforms -- including collision-resistant hash functions, digital signatures and classical consensus algorithms. From there, we will examine the architecture of modern blockchain platforms, and develop tools to analyze and interact with them in Python. At the end of this course, students should understand the power and limitations of blockchain technology, and be able to develop software that interacts with current blockchain platforms.",

The course begins with an exposition of some of the fundamental theorems about the behavior of first-order logic in the context of finite structures, in particular, the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Theorem and the Trahktenbrot Theorem. The first of these results is used to show limitations on the expressive power of first-order logic over finite structures while the second result demonstrates that the problem of reasoning about finite structures using first-order logic is surprisingly complex. The course then proceeds to consider various extensions of first-order logic including fixed-point operators, generalized quantifiers, infinitary languages, and higher-order languages. The expressive power of these extensions will be studied in detail and will be connected to various problems in the theory of computational complexity. This last motif, namely the relation between descriptive and computational complexity, will be one of the main themes of the course.",

Given the limits of individual machines (compute power, memory, bandwidth), increasingly the solution is to process the data in parallel on many machines. This course focuses on the fundamentals of scaling computation to handle common data analytics tasks. You will learn about basic tasks in collecting, wrangling, and structuring data; programming models for performing certain kinds of computation in a scalable way across many compute nodes; common approaches to converting algorithms to such programming models; standard toolkits for data analysis consisting of a wide variety of primitives; and popular distributed frameworks for analytics tasks such as filtering, graph analysis, clustering, and classification. Recommended: broad familiarity with probability and statistics, as well as programming in Python. Additional background in statistics, data analysis (e.g., in Matlab or R), and machine learning is helpful (example : ESE 542).",

In addition to creation of original art and animation assets for the game, technical features to be designed and implemented include a nove l game mechanic and\/or user interaction model, game physics (i.e. particle systems and rigid body dynamics), character animation, game AI (i.e. movement control, path planning, decision making, etc.), sound effects and effects and background music, 2D graphical user interface (GUI) design and optional multiplayer networking capabilities. Consistent with standard industry practices, game code and logic will be written using C++ and popular scripting languages such as Python and Lua. State-of-the-art game and physics engine middleware also will be used to expose students to commercial-grade software, production methodologies and art asset pipelines. As a result of their game development efforts, students will learn first hand about the creative process, design documentation, object-oriented software design and engineering, project management (including effective team collaboration and communication techniques), design iteration through user feedback and play-testing, and most importantly, what makes a game fun to play.",

Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic.
